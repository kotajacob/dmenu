dmenu - dynamic menu - kota's fork
==================================
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.
This is my personal fork with a few useful patches.

Patches
-------
* custom centering
	The standard center patch on suckless.org is extremely slow when reading large
	files because it reads all items, then loops through to determine the string
	length before displaying a window. This patch implements centering, but does
	not calculate a width automatically. Instead you may manually pass in a width
	using the new -z flag.

* border
	Allows setting a window border. Helps make the window standout a bit. Size can
	be configured in config.h

* fuzzymatch
	This patch adds support for fuzzy-matching to dmenu, allowing users to type
	non-consecutive portions of the string to be matched. It can be turned off
	with the -F flag.

* dmenu_dprint script
	I've added a new helper script for use with my dprint program. My dprint
	program is a replacement for the standard "listing your entire $PATH" approach
	to launching programs. Instead it prints from .desktop files allowing you to
	customize the names of entries seperate from the command they run.
	Additionally, it creates a cache and lists programs by how often you run them
	by default. Get dprint here: https://git.sr.ht/~kota/dprint

* changed the default colors lol :P
